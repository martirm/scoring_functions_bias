# Scoring Functions Bias
This repository contains the code used to perform the experiments in the article "Identifying bias in network cluster quality metrics" by Mart√≠ Renedo Mirambell and Argimiro Arratia.

The code is structured as follows:
- For the single-level experiments, [single_level_computation.R](single_level_computation.R) performs de experiments, saves the results to [scores_table.RData](scores_table.RData), and [single_level_analysis.R](single_level_analysis.R) builds the table (table 3 in the article).
- For the multi-level case, [multi_level_SBM_computation.R](multi_level_SBM_computation.R) and [multi_level_BA_computation.R](multi_level_BA_computation.R) perform the experiments, and [multi_level_analysis.R](multi_level_analysis.R) builds the plots (figures 3 and 6 in the article). These plots are saved in [./plots](plots).

The implementations of the scoring functions and the multi-level preferential attachment models are part of the clustAnalytics R package.
